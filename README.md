# GDP Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is about analyzing GDP data from different countries and regions. It looks at how GDP has grown over time and compares different countries. The project uses Python to clean and analyze the data and creates easy-to-understand graphs to show the results.

## Features
- **Understanding the Data**: Looked at the columns in the dataset to understand what each one means.
- **Region Focus**: Studied GDP trends in the Arab World.
- **Country Focus**:
  - Checked GDP growth for specific countries like India and China.
  - Compared GDP numbers between countries.
- **Global View**:
  - Checked GDP trends for all countries from 1960 to 2016.
  - Made graphs to show how GDP changed over time.
- **Custom Comparisons**:
  - Compared GDP between specific countries chosen by the user.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: A Python library used to clean and process the data.
- **Plotly**: A library to make interactive graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used to write the code and see the results step by step.

## How to Use
### Step 1: Set Up the Project
1. Download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gdp-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas plotly
   ```
3. Place the `gdp.csv` file in the same folder as the project.

### Step 2: Run the Analysis
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GDP_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to run the analysis. Each section has clear instructions on what it does.

## What This Project Does
- Shows GDP growth trends for all countries and specific regions.
- Helps compare GDP numbers between countries, like India and China.
- Creates interactive graphs that make it easier to see how GDP has changed.

## Dataset
The project uses a file called `gdp.csv`. This file has GDP data for many countries from 1960 to 2016. Make sure this file is in the project folder before running the code.

## Ideas for Improvement
- Add analysis for GDP per person.
- Include more economic data to get a bigger picture.
- Build a simple website to show the graphs and comparisons.
